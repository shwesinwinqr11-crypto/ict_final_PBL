        <h2 class="impact_intro_title">Understanding the Impact of Our Actions</h2>
        <p class="impact_intro_text">
            Human activities in the park can greatly influence its health, beauty, and safety. 
            Actions such as littering, damaging plants, or misusing public facilities can harm wildlife, 
            disrupt the environment, and negatively affect the experience of other visitors. 
            This section explores how these behaviors impact the park and why responsible choices matter.

             <h2 class="why_its_important_h2">Littering<hr></h2>

            <p>Littering occurs when visitors leave behind waste such as plastic bottles, food wrappers, cans, tissues, and other rubbish instead of disposing of them properly in bins. Sometimes, trash is also tossed near water areas, hidden behind bushes, or simply dropped on walking paths without any consideration. Even small actions like leaving snack packaging on a bench, throwing cigarette butts into the grass, or simply walking away from a picnic area without cleaning up contribute to this problem. These careless behaviors may seem minor in the moment, but when hundreds of people do the same thing every day, the park quickly becomes polluted.

            <h2 class="why_its_important_h2">Effects of littering<hr></h2>
            <p>The impact of littering extends far beyond making the park look messy. Wildlife such as birds, fish, and small mammals can mistake trash for food, leading to serious health problems or even death. Plastics break down slowly and contaminate soil and water, affecting plants and animals over time. Litter also attracts pests and unpleasant odors, making the environment unhygienic for visitors. When the park is filled with trash, people feel less safe, less relaxed, and less motivated to take care of the space. Additionally, park authorities must spend more money, time, and resources on cleanup efforts—money that could be used instead to improve facilities, plant more trees, or expand community programs.

             <h2 class="why_its_important_h2"> Damaging Plants or Plucking Flowers <hr></h2>

            <p>Many visitors unintentionally harm the park’s greenery by stepping on planted areas, pulling flowers for photos, breaking branches, or picking leaves as souvenirs. Others walk off designated paths, crushing young plants that are still growing. Some people dig up soil, disturb plant beds, or remove seeds and roots without thinking about the consequences. Even actions that seem harmless—like touching delicate flowers, leaning on small tree trunks, or running through garden areas—can cause long-term damage when repeated by many visitors.

          <div class="col-5 col-s-6 why_its_important_text ">
            <h2 class="why_its_important_h2">Effects <hr></h2>
            <p>When plants are damaged, the entire ecosystem suffers. Plucked flowers cannot produce seeds, which means fewer plants will grow in the future. Damaged leaves weaken trees and shrubs, making them more vulnerable to disease or pests. Destroyed plant beds reduce the number of insects and birds that depend on them for food or shelter. Over time, the park becomes less colorful, less vibrant, and less healthy. Visitors lose the chance to enjoy beautifully maintained gardens. Restoring damaged plants requires time, money, and constant care—resources that could be used to improve other areas of the park. A decline in plant health also reduces air quality and affects the natural balance of the environment.</p>

             <h2 class="why_its_important_h2">Damaging Park Facilities <hr></h2>

            <p>Park facilities such as benches, playground equipment, exercise machines, trash bins, and signboards are often damaged due to careless behavior. This includes carving names on wooden surfaces, scratching paint, breaking swings, shaking lampposts, vandalizing signs, or forcing equipment to be used in ways it was never designed for. Some people may peel stickers, pull down decorations, or tamper with public property out of boredom. Others leave markings, graffiti, or spill liquids on surfaces that are not meant to be stained. Over time, even small acts of damage build up and cause serious deterioration.
            </p>
            
        </div>
        <div class="col-5 col-s-6 why_its_important_text ">
            <h2 class="why_its_important_h2">Effects <hr></h2>
            <p>Damaged facilities pose safety risks, especially for children who rely on swings, slides, and climbing frames. Broken equipment can lead to cuts, falls, and injuries. When benches or shelters are vandalized, visitors lose clean and comfortable places to rest. Signboards that are damaged or unreadable can cause people to get lost, misunderstand rules, or accidentally enter restricted areas. The park begins to look neglected, which may attract even more vandalism and disrespectful behavior.
               Repairing public property requires time and funding—resources that could be spent on new equipment, upgraded lighting, or better recreational spaces. When facilities are broken, fewer people feel motivated to visit, which reduces community engagement with the park.

             <h2 class="why_its_important_h2">Effects on Visitors <hr></h2>

            <p>Visitor experience is affected when others behave irresponsibly—leaving trash behind, shouting loudly, damaging public property, feeding animals improperly, or ignoring park rules. Even actions like crowding small spaces, blocking walking paths, or playing loud music disrupt the peaceful environment the park is meant to provide. When visitors do not respect shared spaces, others cannot enjoy the park fully.</p>

          <div class="col-5 col-s-6 why_its_important_text ">
            <h2 class="why_its_important_h2"> Effects<hr></h2>
            <p>The overall atmosphere of the park changes when it is not cared for. Instead of feeling calm, welcomed, and relaxed, visitors often feel stressed, disappointed, or discouraged. Litter makes the park appear dirty and unsafe. Damaged plants and vandalized facilities reduce its beauty and quality. Noise pollution disturbs families, elderly people, and those who come to enjoy nature. Over time, fewer people visit, and the community loses a valuable place for exercise, recreation, and connection. A neglected park reduces community pride and affects the mental well-being of those who rely on green spaces for stress relief, socialization, and physical activity.</p>
